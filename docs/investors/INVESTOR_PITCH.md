## 👤 The Founder

**Solo founder. Already proven. Moving at warp speed.**

- **Previous Build:** 400,000+ LOC codebase (shipped)
- **Current Build:** 179,168 LOC in under 7 days
- **Velocity:** 25,000+ lines of production code per day

## 💢 The Problem

### Angi & Thumbtack Are Robbing Contractors

| Platform | Cost to Contractors |
|----------|---------------------|
| Angi | $15-$100+ **per lead** |
| Thumbtack | $20-$150+ **per lead** |
| HomeAdvisor | $15-$75+ **per lead** |

**A typical contractor on Angi pays $1,000-$3,000/month** just for the *chance* to get work.

- They pay even if they don't win the job
- Lead quality is often garbage
- Contractors hate it but have no alternative

**3.7 million contractors. All getting robbed. All looking for an exit.**

## ✅ The Solution

### FairTradeWorker: Zero Fees. Forever.

| FairTradeWorker | Competitors |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **$0 per lead** | $15-$100+ per lead |
| **$59/mo flat** (Pro optional) | $1,000+/mo average |
| **Keep 100%** of earnings | Platform takes 15-30% |
| **Full CRM included** | Basic tools only |
| **AI Receptionist** | Not available |

**That's not a feature difference. That's a revolution.**

## 🏆 Competitive Moat

### Why Competitors Can't Respond

**Angi/Thumbtack are trapped:**
- Their entire business model is lead fees
- If they go to $0 lead fees, they die
- They can't match without destroying themselves

**New entrants are locked out:**
- 400k+ LOC head start
- 7 days to MVP that took them years
- Network effects compound daily

### Our Advantages

1. **Velocity** — Building at 25k+ LOC/day
2. **Zero Fee Model** — Competitors can't match
3. **Infrastructure** — Enterprise-grade from day one
4. **Market Timing** — Contractor frustration at all-time high
