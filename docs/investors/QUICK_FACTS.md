## 🎯 The Pitch (30 seconds)

> "FairTradeWorker is the Angi killer. Contractors on Angi pay $1,000+/month in lead fees. On FairTradeWorker, they pay $0 per lead and keep 100% of what they earn. I built 180,000 lines of production code in under 7 days. The platform is live. The market is 3.7 million contractors who are tired of getting robbed."

## 💬 Common Questions & Answers

### "How do you make money with zero lead fees?"

**Answer:** Pro subscription at $59/mo, add-ons like AI Receptionist ($29/mo), Territory Lock ($49/mo). 85% gross margin. Contractors save $10,000+/year vs Angi, so $59/mo is nothing.

---

### "Why can't Angi just copy you?"

**Answer:** Their entire revenue model is lead fees. If they go to $0 lead fees, they lose 80%+ of revenue. They're trapped. We're not.

---

### "What's stopping someone else from building this?"

**Answer:** I have a 400k line head start. Built another 180k in a week. By the time anyone catches up, I'll have the network effects locked.

---

### "Why should I believe the projections?"

**Answer:** I've already shipped a 400k LOC codebase before this one. I built this in 7 days. The infrastructure is production-ready today. This isn't a projection based on hope — it's based on execution.

---

### "Are you raising?"

**Answer:** Not actively. I'm executing. But if the right partner wants in early, I'd consider $500K-$2M at a $5-10M valuation to accelerate contractor acquisition.

---

### "What's your background?"

**Answer:** I'm a builder. I've shipped 400,000+ lines of code before this project. I built FairTradeWorker — 179,000 lines — in under 7 days. I move fast and I don't stop.

---

### "What's built today?"

**Answer:** Everything. Full CRM, AI Receptionist that answers contractor phones 24/7, job matching, invoicing, territory management, photo/video documentation, referral system. All production-ready. Live at fairtradeworker.com.
