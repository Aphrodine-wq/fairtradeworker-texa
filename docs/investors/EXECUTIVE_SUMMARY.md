# FairTradeWorker — Executive Summary (1-Pager)

---

## The Company

**FairTradeWorker** is a zero-fee home services marketplace that lets contractors keep 100% of what they earn.

**Founded:** December 2024 (< 30 days old)  
**Product:** Production-ready (179,168 LOC)  
**Build Time:** < 7 days  
**Live:** [fairtradeworker.com](https://www.fairtradeworker.com)

## The Problem

**Angi, Thumbtack, and HomeAdvisor charge contractors $15-$100+ per lead.**

A typical contractor pays $1,000-3,000/month just for leads — and they pay even when they *don't* win the job.

**3.7 million contractors in the US are getting robbed. All looking for an exit.**

## The Solution

| FairTradeWorker | Competitors |
|-----------------|-------------|
| $0 per lead | $15-$100+ per lead |
| $59/mo flat (Pro) | $1,000+/mo |
| Keep 100% | Platform takes 15-30% |

**Plus:** Full CRM, AI Receptionist, job matching, invoicing, territory management — all included.

## Why We Win

1. **Competitors can't respond** — Their entire model is lead fees. If they match us, they die.
2. **Infrastructure advantage** — 179k LOC in 7 days. Enterprise-grade from day one.
3. **Founder velocity** — Previously shipped 400k LOC codebase. Building at 25k+ LOC/day.
4. **Market timing** — Contractor frustration at all-time high.
