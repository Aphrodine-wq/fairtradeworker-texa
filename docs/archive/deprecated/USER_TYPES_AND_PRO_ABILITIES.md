## Revenue Model

- **Contractors**: $0 fees on all jobs - keep 100% of earnings
- **Homeowners**: Pay platform fee to post jobs (tiered: $15 flat for quick fixes, 3% for standard, 2.5% for major projects)
- **Pro Subscriptions**: Optional monthly subscriptions for enhanced features
  - Homeowner Pro: $25/month
  - Contractor Pro: $59/month

## Key Principle

**Contractors keep 100% of what they earn. Always.**

Pro subscriptions are optional enhancements that provide advanced business tools, but they do not affect the core principle that contractors pay zero fees on completed jobs.
