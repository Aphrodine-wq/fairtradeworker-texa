## Infrastructure Overview

This isn't hobby code. This is enterprise-grade infrastructure:

- **Frontend:** React/Vite/TypeScript (GPU-accelerated, 60fps)
- **Backend:** Serverless (Vercel Edge + Supabase)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Row Level Security
- **Storage:** CDN-backed media storage
- **AI:** Integrated AI Receptionist, smart matching
- **Real-time:** WebSocket connections for live updates
- **Mobile:** PWA + native iOS capability
- **Offline:** Local-first architecture

**179,168 lines of production code. Built for scale.**

## Cost Philosophy

**Lean until revenue. Scale with growth. Never overspend.**

The infrastructure is built to handle millions of users. The costs only come when the users do.

## Scaling Triggers

### When to Upgrade
- **Database:** When query latency > 100ms p95
- **Compute:** When edge response > 200ms p95
- **CDN:** When cache hit rate < 90%
- **AI:** When API costs exceed self-hosting breakeven

### Cost Optimization Strategies
1. **Aggressive caching** — 90%+ cache hit rate
2. **Edge computing** — Process at the edge, not origin
3. **Smart batching** — Batch AI requests
4. **Lazy loading** — Only load what's needed
5. **Image optimization** — WebP, AVIF, responsive

## Team Costs (When You're Ready)

| Role | Year | Salary | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| First hire (support) | 2 | $60K | When >5K Pro subs |
| DevOps/SRE | 3 | $150K | When >$50M ARR |
| Senior engineer | 3 | $180K | When >$50M ARR |
| Product manager | 4 | $140K | When >$100M ARR |
| Marketing | 4 | $120K | When >$100M ARR |

**Or don't hire at all.** At <1% infrastructure costs, you can run this profitably forever as a solo operation.

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Vendor Lock-in
- **Mitigation:** All infrastructure is portable (Postgres, standard CDN, containerized)
- **Backup plan:** Can migrate to AWS/GCP in <30 days if needed

### Traffic Spikes
- **Mitigation:** Serverless auto-scales, CDN handles burst
- **Backup plan:** Emergency scaling budget ($10K/mo reserve)

### Provider Outages
- **Mitigation:** Multi-region deployment by Year 3
- **Backup plan:** Failover to secondary provider

---

## The Bottom Line

**Infrastructure costs will never be your problem.**

At <1% of revenue, you could 10x your infrastructure spend and still have 90%+ margins. The infrastructure is built for billion-dollar scale. The costs scale linearly while revenue scales exponentially.

**20-Year Infrastructure Total:** ~$81M  
**20-Year Revenue:** ~$9.5B  
**Infrastructure ROI:** 117x

This is what happens when someone who's shipped 400k+ LOC builds infrastructure. It's done right the first time.
