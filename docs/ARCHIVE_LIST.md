# Docs Archive Index

This file lists documentation that is archived, deprecated, or proposed for archival. It is an index and rationale only — no files are deleted by this list. To archive a document, move it into `docs/archive/deprecated/` and add a short rationale entry here.

## Archival Policy
- Keep an index entry for each archived doc with the reason and date.
- Maintain at least one pointer back to the archived doc from the topical folder.
- Archive when the doc is outdated, superseded by a newer doc, or no longer relevant to current architecture.

## Current Archive Candidates / Locations
- `docs/archive/deprecated/` — historical or removed designs and notes.
- `docs/archive/fixes/` — small fixes and one-off notes that don't merit top-level docs.

## Suggested files to review for archival
(maintainers should review and move files as appropriate; this is a proposal list)
- Legacy marketing drafts or obsolete pricing tables.
- Topic drafts superseded by `docs/design/` or `docs/technical/` updates.

## How to archive
1. Move the file to `docs/archive/deprecated/`.
2. Add a short entry to this file with filename, date, and rationale.
3. Update any cross-references to point to the archive location.
